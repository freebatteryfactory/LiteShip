/**
 * Capsule declaration locking the GraphPatch round-trip identity as a standing
 * `pureTransform` contract: `apply(a, diff(a, b))` deep-equals `b`. Where
 * `canonical-cbor-decode.ts` proves the byte reader inverts the byte writer,
 * this proves the structural DIFFER inverts itself over two {@link DocumentGraph}
 * identities — the contract the future graph editor builds against.
 *
 * WHY `pureTransform` (not `receiptedMutation`): `run` is a PURE function of its
 * input — `diff` then `apply`, no receipt byte law, no async hashing, no mutate
 * channel. `GraphPatch.receipt` (the receipted seam) is deliberately NOT exercised
 * here; the round-trip identity is a value-level property the pure-transform
 * harness's property test fits exactly.
 *
 * WHY THE INPUT IS SEED MATERIAL (not raw `DocumentGraph`s): a `DocumentGraph`
 * is content-addressed — its node `id`s and graph `id`/`digest` are `fnv1a` over
 * the canonical CBOR of the payload, minted ONLY through `sealNode`/`sealGraph`.
 * The schema-driven arbitrary (`schemaToArbitrary`) cannot mint those addresses;
 * a raw `Struct` arbitrary would emit graphs with garbage `id`s that `apply`
 * re-seals away, making the round-trip vacuously red on EVERY sample. So the
 * input schema generates a small, fully-supported SEED domain (axis-name lists +
 * acyclic edge index pairs) and `run` SEALS it into two real, valid, sealed
 * graphs through the one kernel. The invariants then assert over those REAL
 * sealed graphs (returned in the output), so the property they verify is the
 * genuine `diff`/`apply`/`validate` contract, never a weakened stand-in.

 * node MULTISET (by node id) and edge MULTISET (by structural triple). This is

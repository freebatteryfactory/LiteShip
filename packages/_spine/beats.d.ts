 * @czap beat contract family — declaration-only types spanning the
 * beat-projection pipeline (CUT A5). One home, two stages, two unit spaces:
 *
 *   1. {@link BeatMarkerSet}  — raw asset/sample-space projection produced by
 *      `@czap/assets` (`BeatMarkerProjection` / `detectBeats`). This is the
 *      contract carried by the `asset:beats` capability.
 *   2. {@link BeatComponent}  — scene/world timeline-space marker consumed by
 *      `@czap/scene` (`bindBeats` / `scene.beat-binding`).
 *   3. {@link BeatSpawn}      — the ECS spawn descriptor wrapping a resolved
 *      {@link BeatComponent}.
 *
 * The sample-index → millisecond resolution between stages 1 and 2 is a
 * scene-owned transform (`resolveBeatProjectionToSceneBeats`), described by
 * {@link BeatProjectionResolutionInput}. These types carry no runtime
 * behavior — `@czap/assets` and `@czap/scene` alias their public names to
 * them so the shape lives in exactly one place.

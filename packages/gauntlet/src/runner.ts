/**
 * The real-repo runner — the ONE live entrypoint that runs the gauntlet over the
 * actual tree, with the committed assurance map and the committed waivers applied.
 *
 * `runGauntletOnRepo` is the production composition of {@link runGates} +
 * {@link nodeContext}: it globs the repo into a {@link GateContext} and runs the
 * gates through the same authority ratchet the in-memory path uses. The
 * filesystem touch is confined to {@link nodeContext}; this module just composes.
 *
 * Crucially, this is NOT dead convenience sugar — {@link litelaunchGauntlet}
 * binds the real built-in gate set, the committed {@link LITESHIP_ASSURANCE_MAP},
 * and the committed {@link LITESHIP_WAIVERS} into one call. The dogfood tests
 * exercise THIS function over `packages/&#42;/src`, so the waivers in `waivers.ts`
 * actually govern a real run (a waiver that suppresses nothing on the real repo
 * has no teeth; here they do — an active boundary waiver suppresses its finding,
 * an expired one re-reds and blocks).

/**
 * Check-governance FactPack — the type-only fact shape the three check-governance
 * META-GATES decide over (`check-registry-complete` / `check-negative-control` /
 * `check-waiver-freshness`). NO dependency on `@liteship/command` (the check registry
 * lives THERE, and `@liteship/command` deps `@liteship/gauntlet`, so the gauntlet must
 * not import it back — the dependency arrow points ONE way). Instead a HOST (the
 * `tests/unit/devops` meta-test, or a future CLI host) reads `CHECK_REGISTRY` /
 * `SCRIPT_EXEMPTIONS` / `package.json` / the filesystem / `LITESHIP_WAIVERS` / the
 * traceability ledger against an injected wall-clock date, folds the DECIDED verdicts
 * into this flat record, and injects it; the gates only decide. Same lean-engine
 * pattern as {@link ActiveSurfaceFacts}: the gauntlet RECEIVES the facts, never
 * computes them (no fs, no clock, no `@liteship/command` import).
